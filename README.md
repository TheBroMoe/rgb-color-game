## About:
Recently I have been picking up a lot of javascript and wanted to practice DOM Manipulation, event handling, responsive web design, as well as css styling. I liked the idea of making a guessing game based off the rgb color scheme as the scheme can be a bit unintuitive without practice. I was able to put the webpage together in a couple of hours and may make changes to the webpage's format or add additional content in the future. Hope you have a good time with it!
## How to Play:
The game starts by generating a list of random colors and selecting one and displaying it's rgb value you and have to guess the corresponding color based on the given list. There are two difficulties: an easy and a hard mode which modifies how many different choices there are. You can play again by hitting the reset button after winning or losing and all the colors will be generated again.

## How to Use:
Just download the RGB_ColorGame files and run the page in your preferred browser.
