## About:
Recently I have been picking up a lot of javascript and wanted to practice DOM Manipulation, event handling, responsive web design, as well as css styling. I liked the idea of making a guessing game based off the rgb color scheme as the scheme can be a bit unintuitive without practice. I was able to put the webpage together in a couple of hours and may make changes to the webpage's format or add additional content in the future. Hope you have a good time with it!

## How to Use:
Just download the RGB_ColorGame files and run the page in your preferred browser.
